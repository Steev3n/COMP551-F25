# Assignment 1 README

This assignment involved further exploration with linear regression, this time with non-linear bases and non-linear datasets. We explore the concept of under/overfitting through fitting models with various numbers of Gaussian bases and seeing the effect that it has on the validation/test errors. We also explore the effects of regularization (L1, L2) on the loss surface and the weights.

## How to run the project

A Jupyter notebook that includes all of the code for the assignment has been provided under the `A2code.ipynb` file. The `requirements.txt` houses all of the dependencies that were used throughout the notebook. If one does not execute the notebook under a Google Colab environment, the user simply needs to execute the following commmand in their terminal to install the required dependencies. The command may be executed in a virtual environment or not.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
