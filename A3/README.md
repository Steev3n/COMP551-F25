# Assignment 3 README

This assignment involved experimenting with MLPs and CNNs on the FashionMNIST dataset. Various experiments, such as varying network depth, adding regularization, changing the activation function, introducing data augmentation, etc. were used and their performances were tested. We also worked with a pretrained CNN model - ResNet.

## How to run the project

A Jupyter notebook that includes all of the code for the assignment has been provided under the `A2code.ipynb` file. The `requirements.txt` houses all of the dependencies that were used throughout the notebook. If one does not execute the notebook under a Google Colab environment, the user simply needs to execute the following commmand in their terminal to install the required dependencies. The command may be executed in a virtual environment or not.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
