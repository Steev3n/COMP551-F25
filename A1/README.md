# Assignment 1 README

This assignment invovled implementing linear regression and logistic regression from scratch (with NumPy) using an analytical solution or gradient descent. Various experiments, like varying learning rate, batch size, etc., were conducted on both models with their respective datasets with results displayed in the Jupyter notebooks.

## How to run the project

A Jupyter notebook that includes all of the code for the assignment has been provided under the `A1code.ipynb` file. The `requirements.txt` houses all of the dependencies that were used throughout the notebook. If one does not execute the notebook under a Google Colab environment, the user simply needs to execute the following commmand in their terminal to install the required dependencies. The command may be executed in a virtual environment or not.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
